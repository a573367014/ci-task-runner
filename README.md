[[English]](./README.md) - [[简体中文]](./README.ZH-CN.md)

This is a multiprocess building tasks scheduler, which is written based on NodeJS. It supports the increment and parallel building and can improve the speed of server building largely.

As a common task scheduler, Ci-task-runner enhances the running speed of the tools such as Jenkins, Gitlab-CI or Webpack, Gulp rather than take place of them.

> "After moving a large frond-end program to this continuous integration system for building, we took around 10 minutes to modify every minor file. We had to develop this ci-task-runner which reduces the time to 1 minutes."

## Principle

1\. **Incremental Building**:

Medium and large project needs full dose building if a little file has changed, in this way the building speed will be very slow. For sloving this problem, ci-task-runner diff commit logs of Git or Svn and building changed file.

2\. **Parallel Building**:

If multiple tasks be executed, ci-task-runner will initiate a new process according to current server's CPU quantities, using mutiprocess parallel building to finish tasks quickly.

## Installation

```shell
npm install ci-task-runner -g
```

## Basic Usage
Ci-task-runner's tasks are defined in the JSON, in the project to create a new `.ci-task-runner.json` file, example:

```json
{
  "tasks": ["mod1", "mod2", "mod3"],
  "cache": ".ci-task-runner-cache.json",
  "repository": "git",
  "program": "cd ${taskPath} && webpack --color"
}
```


And then run the command in the project directory to perform the above defined `tasks`

```shell
ci-task-runner
```

Above-mentioned: mod1、mod2、mod3 will run `cd ${taskPath} && webpack --color` ordered by catelogue changed.

According basic usage, the most difference between the task concept of ci-task-runner and other task executors is that each task is based on a file or folder in the code repository.

> Using CI tools run ci-task-runner On the server, reference: [Continuous integration](#continuous-integration).

## Configuration

### `tasks`

Task target list, the target can be any directory or file in the repository.

Simplified: `{string[]}`

```json
{
  "tasks": ["mod1", "mod2", "mod3"]
}
```

Advanced: `{Object[]}`

```json
{
  "tasks": [
      {
          "name": "mod1",
          "path": "path/mod1",
          "dependencies": ["common/v1"],
          "program": "cd ${taskPath} && gulp"
      },
      "mod2",
      "mod3"
  ]
}
```

1. [`dependencies`](#dependencies) and [`program`](#program) will inherit the top of the configuration, or cover it.
2. [`tasks`](#tasks) support configure parallel tasks, reference: [Mutiprocess Parallel Tasks](#mutiprocess-parallel-tasks).

### `cache`
ci-task-runner cache files write path, used to save the last task info. Default: `ci-task-runner-cache.json`

> Ignore `.ci-task-runner-cache.json` in repository.

### `dependencies`

Task target external dependency list. If the task target relies on a library outside the directory, you can specify the dependency manually, so that changes to the external library can also trigger the task to run.

> ci-task-runner use Git or Svn to realize changed detection, so the path must already be versioned

### `repository`

Setting the type of repository. Support Git and Svn.

### `parallel`

Set the maximum number of parallel progress. Default: `require('os').cpus().length`.

### `program`

Running task's configuration.

Simplified: `{string}`

```json
{
  "program": "cd ${taskPath} && node build.js"
}
```

Advanced: `{Object}`

```json
{
  "program": {
    "command": "node build.js",
    "options": {
      "cwd": "${taskPath}",
      "timeout": 360000
    }
  }
}
```

#### `program.command`

Setting start command.

> program will put `${options.cwd}/node_modules/.bin` and `${process.cwd()}/node_modules/.bin` in environment variable `PATH`, like `npm scripts` install on local.

#### `program.options`

Progress configuration. Reference: [child_process.exec](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback).

> The `timeout` field in `program.options` takes effect and terminates the process and throws an error. `child_process.exec` only throw error.

#### Variable

`program` supporting string variable.

* `${taskName}` task name
* `${taskPath}` task target absolute path
* `${taskDirname}` equal to `path.diranme(taskPath)`，[detail](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_dirname_path)

## Configuration Example

### Mutiprocess Parallel Tasks

If tasks have no dependencies in each other, it can open mutiprocess run task, then take full advantage of multi-core CPU accelerating running.

Tasks outside task name is serial run, if array will parallel running:

```json
{
  "tasks": ["dll", ["mod1", "mod2", "mod3"]],
  "cache": "dist/.ci-task-runner-cache.json",
  "repository": "git",
  "program": "cd ${taskPath} && webpack --color"
}
```

Above-mentioned: when dll has build, mod1、mod2、mod3 will parallel building by mutiprocess.

### Change Dependencies Trigger Buliding

```json
{
  "tasks": ["dll", ["mod1", "mod2", "mod3"]],
  "dependencies": ["dll", "package.json"],
  "cache": "dist/.ci-task-runner-cache.json",
  "repository": "git",
  "program": "cd ${taskPath} && webpack --color"
}
```

Above-mentioned: when dll and package.json has changed, whatever other task's target has changed or not it will be forced to building.

### Auto Updating Npm Packages

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "package.json",
      "program": "npm install"
    },
    "dll",
    ["mod1", "mod2", "mod3"]
  ],
  "dependencies": ["package.json", "dll"],
  "cache": "dist/.ci-task-runner-cache.json",
  "repository": "git",
  "program": "cd ${taskPath} && webpack --color"
}
```

Above-mentioned: when package.json has changed, it will run `npm install` to install dependencies to keep project up-to-date.

## Continuous integration

Using CI tool to run ci-task-runner on server-site.

**About:**

* gitlab: gitlab-ci
* github: travis
* Jenkins
